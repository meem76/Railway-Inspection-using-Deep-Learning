##Project Title: Fault detection-by-resnet-efficientnet-inception

Overview

This project aims to develop a robust deep learning model for automated railway inspection. The goal is to accurately identify and classify potential defects in railway tracks, including cracks and surface irregularities. By automating this process, we can enhance safety, efficiency, and reduce maintenance costs.

#Dataset

The dataset used for training and validation consists of high-resolution images. Data augmentation techniques were applied to increase dataset diversity and improve model generalization, such as:

    Geometric transformations: Rotation, flipping, shearing
    Color space manipulations: Adjusting brightness, contrast
    

#Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing steps include:

    Image resizing: Images are resized to a standardized input size for the chosen models.
    Normalization: Pixel intensity values are normalized to a specific range .

#Deep Learning Models

Three state-of-the-art deep learning architectures were explored and compared:

    ResNet152V2: A powerful residual network with 152 layers, capable of capturing intricate features.
    EfficientNetB7: An efficient neural network architecture designed for image classification, balancing accuracy and computational cost.
    InceptionV3: A deep convolutional neural network with an inception module, allowing for parallel processing of features at different scales.

#Training and Evaluation

    Training:
        Models were trained using a suitable optimizer (e.g., Adam) and loss function (e.g., categorical cross-entropy).
        Hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, batch size) were tuned to optimize performance.
        Data augmentation techniques were employed during training to further enhance model robustness.
    Evaluation:
        Models were evaluated on a held-out validation set using standard metrics like accuracy, and F1-score.
        Confusion matrices were generated to visualize classification performance.

#Results and Discussion

In the end the best model was the ResNet model and the worst was the EffientNet with Inception falling in the middle

#Future Work

    Real-time Implementation: Develop a real-time system for on-site inspection.
    Multi-modal Learning: Incorporate additional data modalities (e.g., thermal or acoustic data) for enhanced defect detection.
    Transfer Learning: Explore transfer learning techniques to leverage pre-trained models and reduce training time.
    Explainable AI: Apply XAI techniques to understand model decision-making and improve transparency.
